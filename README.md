# mgsc310_final
R scripts for MGSC 310 final project.

# This is our final project for MGSC 310-01 Statistical Modeling in Business
#   Created by Amanda Weaver, John Uhl, Steve Leon, and Noah Perkins 2023

# This was created to use a youtube and spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle (link below) which, with some modifications,
# was used to predict a songs views on their official youtube video (ViewsM in the cleaned dataset). We chose to implement linear regression
# and random forest models. There are no known errors in the code with the packages installed.

# For use, download the songs_clean.csv file, and any data cleaning or feature transformation can be ignored except for grading or code 
# checking purposes.
